## Protein Folding
**Predict the 3-dimensional structure of a protein from its 1-dimensional polypeptide chain.** The folding process happens automatically in nature giving a protein its 3-d structure, which decides the funtions of a protein. Proteins with similar 3-d structures would have similar functions, even if they have different polypeptide chains. This has important applications in designing and engineering proteins for novel functions.

## Short-term Earthquake Prediction
**Predict the time, location, and magnitude of the next earthquakes.** There are several measurable properties of the earth such as *foreshocks, water level, leaked gases, magnetic field, ionosphere, Van Allen belts, etc.* that may be precursors before an earthquake happens. However, the relationships between these potential indicators and the earthquakes are very complex. The goal is to model these complex relationships to make accurate prediction in useful short term, from seconds to months in advance. 

Note: Most earthquake datasets only contain information about the shocks. [TODO]: Find data about precursors of earthquake.
